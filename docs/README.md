# Scope and Purpose

The purpose of this website is to serve as a professional portfolio for myself. It aims to be an effective marketing tool for my brand and show some of my skills as a developer. The website has four main pages: 
- Home Page
- Portfolio of past work
- Biography of myself
- Contact page

To create a modern portfolio site the website must be responsive to multiple screen resolutions on all pages.
